        <h5 class="card-title text-center mt-5">About Us</h5>
        <p class="card-text mt-4">Our home-solutions firm, RMS, was established in Maharashtra by Pranay Masurkar in November of 
 2022.Our founder had experienced a common problem â€“ Managing Rental details in a big Apartments. 

 We concluded that people Renting thier homes and Apartments not to adopt one more problem or stress in their life, but for earning money and having one more active Recurring Asset At RMS we soon realized that it was necessary to go beyond basics and create a platform that could do much more than just solve the immediate problems of space and peripherals. With globalization and communication taking a forefront, we are aware that society is becoming more disparate. Our response to this is - No city should be a stranger; no person should feel discriminated.  he philosophy behind RMS grew to create an inclusive living environment where youth have choices but are also required to take ownership.  Tenants would have options so that they could choose according to their budget and personal preferences. The burden on owners would get reduced - to look for responsible tenants, do background checks and chase after tenants to pay in their dues. In the future,  we believe RMS as a platform will grow in many other directions,  with housing as the core focus.</p>
